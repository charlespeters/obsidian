This is a simple 12 column grid system that has responsive suffixes. `.o-Column--[1-12]/12[@sm, @md, @lg]`. These are floated columns, so they need to be cleared unless they have a flex parent and occupy a `max-width: 100%` so they can't exceed the width of the parent.

<Snippet component={Grid} snippet={snippet} />
