import { Snippet } from '../../components/snippet'
import { RDTable, snippet } from './demo/rd-table'

This is a responsive table implementation. This is based off of this [demo](https://codepen.io/charlespeters/details/qdYYQE/) and makes heavy use of the `data-heading` attribute on the `<td>` elements.

```html
<td class="table__content" data-heading="Name">Gizmo</td>
```

<Snippet snippet={snippet} component={RDTable} />
