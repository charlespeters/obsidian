import { Snippet } from '../../components/snippet'
import { ResetKitchenSink, snippet } from './demo/reset'

This reset is meant to use [border-box](https://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/) as the box-sizing property, define global typography settings, and clean up a few browser inconsistencies. It's adapted from [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/).

Some key differences are:

- Responsive images and media
- Forms to be semi-consist and to inherit typography related styles

You can also download it as a separate module, [Level.css](https://charliewilco.github.io/level.css/): 

```
yarn add level.css
```
