# Obsidian.css

Obsidian.css is a modular CSS library that focuses on code common to most projects.

This project works under the belief that when abstracted most CSS is shockingly similar across projects. More than likely you'll need a type scale, a grid system, spacing utilities, media blocks, sensible default styling for elements (forms, tables, buttons). This project is a collection of the CSS patterns that have stuck with me over the last two years and grown with me.

Styles are written in an adapted BEM naming convention and organized in an [ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4)-like methodology. It uses [cssnext](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext) to compile variables, custom selectors and custom media queries.

## Installation

For full library:

```
npm install obsidian --save
```

For individual modules (ex. `obsidian.spacing`):

```
npm install obsidian.module-name --save
```

### Using in Build

Recommended you use [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import).

Example using Gulp.js:

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const postcss = require('gulp-postcss');
const atImport = require('postcss-import');
const cssnext  = require('postcss-cssnext');

const processors = [
  atImport,
  cssnext
];

gulp.task('styles', ()=> {
  return gulp.src('path/to/stylesheet')
    .pipe(postcss(processors))
    // Probably other tasks
    .pipe(gulp.dest('path/to/destination'));
})

```
then import into your CSS and modify some variables:

```css

@import 'obsidian';

:root {
  --headlines: 'Proxima Nova Condensed', Lucida Grande, sans-serif;
  --body-text: 'Meta Serif Pro', Charter, serif;
}
```

And things should compile the way you'd expect.

### Issues

**Reduced test cases are required**. All bug reports and problem issues require a reduced test case. See [CSS Tricks - Reduced Test Cases](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) on why they _"are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs."_ Reduced test cases help you identify the issue at hand and understand your own code. On our side, they greatly reduce the amount of time spent resolving the issue.

- A reduced test case is an isolated example that demonstrates the bug or issue.
- It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug. No extra functionality or styling.
- A link to your site is **not** a reduced test case.
- A [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) or [CodePen](http://codepen.io) is preferred so we can help you fix an error.
